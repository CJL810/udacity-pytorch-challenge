# Udacity Pytorch Challenge
Image classifier from scratch that will identify different species of flowers. This is the final project in Udacity PyTorch Scholarship Challenge Nanodegree Program.
Here is the download link to the training and validation dataset https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd188/flower_data.zip.
I used a separate dataset for testing which is the **google_test_data folder**.
Also shout out to **Avinash** for putting together a modified colab notebook to download and load the datasets.
